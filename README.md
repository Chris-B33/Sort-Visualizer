## Description

This application shows a way to visualize different sorting algorithms.
It is written in native JavaScript, no additional libraries were used.
I wanted to make this project after seeing many videos online about visualizing different sorting algorithms and I wanted to make my own version.
"In-place" algorithms like Bubble and Insertion sort were quite trivial to implemement. Any algorithm fully composed of only swapping two elements at a time was easy.
However, "Divide and Conquer" algorithms such as Merge Sort, where we have to keep track of sub-arrays were more difficult as keeping the position of the elements in the overall array was complicated.

## Installation

It is not required to download this repository to run the application. 
Opening <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Chris-B33/sort-visualizer/blob/main/index.html">this link</a> will bring you to a HTML preview through Github to run it.
